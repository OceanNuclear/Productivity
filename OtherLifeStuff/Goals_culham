Project goals:

Goal 0: familiarize self with unfolding suite
	1st milestone: ??
	2nd milestone: ??

Goal 1: look into the feasibility of neuralnetwork (TF/KERAS/scikit-learn) unfolding
	0th milestone: background reading, check what's been done 
	1st milestone: learn to generate parametrised spectra,
	2nd milestone: create training data
	3rd milesteno: see how scalable is the neural network approach to non-parametrised approaches? (literature review again)
	4th milestone: Attempt to get the standard deviations of flux as well.

Goal 2: look into the feasibility of regularization unfolding
	0th milestone: background reading: find versions of codes that does this; and understand the theory behind them.
	1st milestone: unfold a simple case, full-rank, nearly-square.
	2nd milestone: unfold a more complicated case
____
(Goal of the team): benchmark the accuracy of all codes in the unfoldingsuite
	optimize the accuracy for fusion purpose by	- changing group structure
							- changing isotopes used
							(-changing masses/geometry (trivial))
____
Why has no one written what we're doing in the first place?
