I: Glaring problems to fix first
	1-Nuclear-Instrumentation,Multiplying-Media,Radiation-Dosimetry-and-Protection-PastPaper/
- Nuclear electronics: I don't actually know how does each electronic do what they do in detail: read Knoll?
- Particle detectors: X ray detectors: I'm not familiar with them!
- Radiation Protection: Dave gave me a low score on protection and I don't know why?

	-operational principle
	-Efficiency and resolution dependence/response on materials/design
- List all components of the nuclear electronics -> write the characteristics of each component; define "TTL/NIM/ECL"

- Rxr Mat: Make a list for a)irradiation defect type (prismatic loop, vacancy precipitation, bubble, edge dislocation, stacking fault, etc), its energy calculation, and its eventual fate.
- Rxr Mat: Make pretty drawings üíïÔ∏èüíñÔ∏è
- Decom: Just use your template revision list .odt to organize concepts

- Fuel Chemistry: List complete process of modelling, starting from the to its application
- NDE: add extra detail in the ultrasonic technique on top of last year's revision list, + write more reference to the revision lecture slides.
- Material Science: Just use your revision list .odt template; "draw diagram to define Burgers vector of a dislocation"; define "conservative and non-conservative motion"
- Rxr Sys: Draw all reactor using "Lamarsh"; "The Elements of Nuclear Power - Bennet & Thomson"; "Nuclear Reactors - Nero"

	- Replicate the whole transport equation from the most general form to neutron diffusion equation form, noting important milestones; define the name (i.e. give definition) of each term
	- Show that the probability distribution of energy loss is rectangular.
	- Get the average lethargy expresssion (show derivation)
- Rxr Phys: Use the Revision list .odt file, make very pretty looking _M_ and _F_ matrices; explaing how to get them; define "collision density F(E)", "worth/differential of an absorber", "neutron transport cross-section", "diffusion length", "lethargy u(E)", ""

	- List all major distributions mentionsed + all approximations to get to Gaussian
	- Covariance matrix equation derivation for lin-gress
	- How to use the T-test or z-test, and the difference between them
- Thm: Compile all equations and relations from notes; define all terms in Fourier Transport equation, "quality x, void fraction Œ± and slip ratio S", "Nu", "Pr", "the other two dimensionless numbers"
- Rxr Kin: Memorize the form of the L^-1{n(t)} expression (using your mnemonics tricks etc.) + revision checklist .odt ; define "k_eff", "cumulative/independent/chain yield"

Entertainment: (Relearn Lagrangian by taking a course + use old notes)
Entertainment: (Read about back-propagation algorithms )
Entertainment: (Learn Green's function by taking a course)

	How to make consolidate it further:
-	Write code
-	Teach other people by writing a code /book on it
-	Write a report on it
-	Attach pictures of the relevant ore onto the a scrap book
