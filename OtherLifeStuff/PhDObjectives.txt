Purpose: Develop a prototype system of neutron spectrum unfolding for a future nuclear fusion power plant.

Assumption:
- Future fusion plants will use H&A mode (or maybe occassionally L-mode at start-up) confinement
Requirement:
- Such fusion plant's FW has not been decided yet, so we have to be able to unfold n-spec from all types of FW/VV configurations
- (For MCNP-modelling dependent parts:) Our knowledge of the is accurate enough to model the neutron source.
- The neutron spectrum is weakly dependent on the plasma mode and strongly dependent on the FW.
- But can still make assumption about the plasma condition: e.g. isobaric (i.e. constant magnetic pressure) surfaces are isothermal, etc., due to equilibrium.
Objectives
1. Create list of MCNP model with exhaustive list of configurations (FW design, operating modes, DT ratio, plasma geometry, fuel mixture ratio, and other plasma parameters:
	Ion density exponent
	Ion temperature exponents
	Ion density at center
	Ion density at pedestal
	Ion density at separatrix
	Ion temperature at center
	Ion temperature at pedestal
	Ion temperature at separatrix
	Minor radius at pedestal
)
	(Note: if the neutron sources do not accurately represent the real neutron sources of the fusion reactor, then the whole FoilSelection and covariance measurement is wrong (and needs to be updated) )
2. Find the one matrix that is able to unfold each of them with the lowest uncertainty
3. (optional) Find the covariance between these procedurally MCNP-generated spectra?
4. (optional) Optimize the FoilSelector further with the covariance matrix.
____Old plan
1. Use EXISTING (MAXED)
2. Use new (IMAXED, Regularization)
2.5Use Foil Selector to reduce 
2.75 Error propagation with apriori and Rm
3. Use machine learning to break free of these constraints of the a priori
