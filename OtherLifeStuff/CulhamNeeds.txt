Useful unfolding tool for FUSION powerplants
	- Foils at FW
	- VV
Possible benefit to target users:
    Neutronics:
	- Power estimation and management
	    Total area under the curve
	- Tritium breeding and consumption
        - module specific: 
            Li t production reaction, 
            Pb n multiplier reaction,
            etc.
	- Radiation damage estimation and monitoring:
	    - DPA
	    - specific transmutation reaction in the EUROFER
	- Shielding: 
	    high energy part and total yield

    Plasma physics:
    - ?? what part of the spectrum concerns them the most ?

Best procedure procedure:
- irradiate for seconds, minutes, to days.
- hit button for gamma spec (possibly enter information about the gamma spec)
- Give a spectrum with uncertainties. (10-20 min)

Ask about parametric plasma source, WHY, what physical processes

Foil selection tool: we don't have any
	-material properties: no fire, no explosion; no fissionable
		-Add alloys
	-gamma lines do not overlap
	-medium half lives
	-sample the important part of the spectrum
	-IRDF -> EAF
		-Deliberately add self shielding for thermal region? Or not.
