1.why are you doing this?
    Because I want to be better than every other student, in terms of understanding fusion material science.
2.Lower the difficulty of getting into the task by setting up the appropriate software/procedure
    Much of the time it takes to finish a task is taken up by the preparation and planning.
    if you have the to-do list(+ reason for each to do) + app to let you pick up where you left off, then you can easily switch task without losing track/losing sight of purpose
