____
Constantly ask "if this task at hand is bringing me closer to my goal of becoming a nuclear fusion scientist or not?"
Context switching is extremely mentally taxing and the ONLY thing that will ever break your concentration

#wake up at 6:30am -> turn on laptop, write down schedule for the day, include 1 self-development/productivity enhancing task
#Holiday: Wake up at 7:00, turn on laptop, post to-do list on Discord.

--Checklists for tasks and subtasks minimizes time/cognitive switching penalty.
Your brain has no time to wander around, frolicking with all that crap that you don't want to touch right now.--
--If you have the purpose of your next task written down*, your brain will home in on that task because it'll remember about this purpose as soon as you defocus--

I can reduce rate of error-occurance/procrastination by
	1. repeated practice (spaced repetition as well)
	2. Building up a system (develop notations+rules)
		Leave time for redundant review (chance to look at it with a fresh mind) for important meetings/publishings, e.g. double check the required documents on separate days
	3. Getting into the correct(calm) mental state (by eating and exercising correctly)
	(See 17.DailyThought/2018-09-08 for explanation and guilelines.)
Set up systems in such a way that minimizes your effort and decisions required in the future.	#Thus you can focus your energy on doing the task correctly, not on organization/set-up.
Procedurize, procedurize, procedurize.

	To stay functional:
		Keep your productivity toolset usable and clean,
		Clean your work environment,
		+ use studying techniques/mnemonics + use your key skills of communications) and be productive in order to stay intellectually superior.
	To not get lost in my task and lose sight of other perspectives (and become non-socializable):
		Surround yourself with people who may have different priorities, but are at least about as smart as you are.
