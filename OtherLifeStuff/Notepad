2019-01-16 09:17:40 realized I left my student card in either my other pocket OR when returning the other book (unlikely). Should check both books borrowed yesterday (including the returned one) + most visible surfaces of your room for your student ID card.

If you start re-treading the same ideas in your mind, then your system must've failed to capture that idea to unload your brain and free-up the cache, and will immediately break you away from your productive state.

Constantly ask "if this task at hand is bringing me closer to my goal of becoming a nuclear fusion material scientist or not?"

If there's something that you feel vague about, stop what you're doing and focus on recalling that piece of info.
wake up at 6:30am -> turn on laptop, download all lectures, read through them, highlight the parts that you find potentially confusing, and leave by 8.
Holiday: Wake up at 7:30, turn on laptop, post to-do list on Discord.
OWN your learning materials: don't just acquiant them. Find your own way through the new landscape of knowledge.

Next on to-do list: make procrastination-prevention playlist VERY accesible! MORE Accessible than typing "imgur".
if (motivation==False) and (OptionsICanThinkOfRightNow()==["procrastinate","dive into next task on to-do list"]):
	GetMotivationBy( WriteEssay("how is the PROCESS OF the next task significant to your goals, ideals, identity, interest", file="ScratchPad.txt") )
	GetMotivationBy( WatchProductivityVideo() )

	GetComforatbleBy( ListenTo( randomChoose(["postrock","chillstep","dubstep","futurebass"]) ) )
	GetComfortableBy(WriteFloatingThoughts(file="Scratchpad.txt"))	#assuming you have interpersonal relationships problems waiting to be sorted out
	or GetComfortableBy(TakeAWalk())
	GetFlowBy( ToDoList( breakdown(task,subtask) ) )	#make your brain overflow with ideas through making the plan, thus entering flow state.

--Checklists for tasks and subtasks minimizes time/cognitive switching penalty.
Your brain has no time to wander around, frolicking with all that crap that you don't want to touch right now.--
--If you have the purpose of your next task written down*, your brain will home in on that task because it'll remember about this purpose as soon as you defocus--


I can reduce rate of error-occurance/procrastination by
	1. repeated practice (spaced repetition as well)
	2. Building up a system (develop notations+rules)
	3. Getting into the correct(calm) mental state (by eating and exercising correctly)
	(See 17.DailyThought/2018-09-08 for explanation and guilelines.)
Set up systems in such a way that minimizes your effort and decisions required in the future.	#Thus you can focus your energy on doing the task correctly, not on organization/set-up.
Procedurize, procedurize, procedurize.


You need to actively remind yourself to stay mindful of your mental state(drudgeriness), and productivity state(that way you'll know if you're hitting productivity dips)
Limit this daily expenditure of willpower.
	To stay functional:
		Stay mentally alert and awake (i.e. not be afraid of diving into the tedius details 
		+ use studying techniques/mnemonics + use your key skills of communications) and be productive in order to stay intellectually superior.
	To not get lost in my task and lose sight of other perspectives (and become non-socializable):
		Surround yourself with people who may have different priorities, but are at least about as smart as you are.
