--Make a rule of allowing maximum of 1 extra task per day; no more.
Constantly ask "if this task at hand is bringing me closer to my goal of becoming a nuclear fusion scientist or not?"

(occassionally) If there's something that you feel vague about, stop what you're doing and focus on recalling that piece of info.

#wake up at 6:30am -> turn on laptop, download all lectures, read through them, highlight the parts that you find potentially confusing, and leave by 8. <- Need to modify this for the current purpose.
#Holiday: Wake up at 7:00, turn on laptop, post to-do list on Discord.

--Checklists for tasks and subtasks minimizes time/cognitive switching penalty.
Your brain has no time to wander around, frolicking with all that crap that you don't want to touch right now.--
--If you have the purpose of your next task written down*, your brain will home in on that task because it'll remember about this purpose as soon as you defocus--


I can reduce rate of error-occurance/procrastination by
	1. repeated practice (spaced repetition as well)
	2. Building up a system (develop notations+rules)
	3. Getting into the correct(calm) mental state (by eating and exercising correctly)
	(See 17.DailyThought/2018-09-08 for explanation and guilelines.)
Set up systems in such a way that minimizes your effort and decisions required in the future.	#Thus you can focus your energy on doing the task correctly, not on organization/set-up.
Procedurize, procedurize, procedurize.

	To stay functional:
		Keep your productivity toolset + environment easy to use and clean.
		+ use studying techniques/mnemonics + use your key skills of communications) and be productive in order to stay intellectually superior.
	To not get lost in my task and lose sight of other perspectives (and become non-socializable):
		Surround yourself with people who may have different priorities, but are at least about as smart as you are.

		Possible reactions to other people's statements
		Possible conversation topics
