sudo prime-select intel #2018-07-03 21:13:40
2018-07-10 12:52:16 headphone audio is now fixed.
2018-07-11 10:32:38 did the first ANSWER in https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2326395 in attempt to ensure bluetooth is off when I turn on the computer.
2018-08-18 05:17:19 I have just changed all ~/*.sh script's top from #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash
2018-09-11 08:39:50 used lmt-config-gui to turn on cpuhotplugging. Let's see what happens.
2018-09-14 23:28:22 Loading up the latest Ubuntu version (.34) shows the "kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block" page.
	Temporary Fix: load up the .33 version.
	Attempt at fix: update in terminal while in the .33 version.
		First attempt at doing so^: freeze at loading up version ... page instead of the "kernel panic" page.
		Second attempt at doing so": same result as above^.
	Attempt 2 at fix: downloaded /home/ocean/Downloads/linux-tools-4.15.0-34-generic_4.15.0-34.37_16.04.1_i386.deb, and installed it.
		First attempt: Freeze at the blank, dark-purple page when booting from the first option in grub; but shows the "kernel panic" page when booting from the second option in grub (Advanced... ubuntu)
	Attempt 3	: https://askubuntu.com/questions/41930/kernel-panic-not-syncing-vfs-unable-to-mount-root-fs-on-unknown-block0-0
		First attempt: still does nothing.
	Attempt 4	: Turned off cpu hotplugging in lmt.
		First attempt: still shows the same screen. /home/ocean/Documents/UbuntuDebugging/DSC_0949.JPG
		More in-depth reading of the error message in the above link leads me to believe that it is possibly another feat of Nvidia.
		I will deal with this later, when I have time.
		In the meantime, I'll boot up from Advanced -> 4.15.0-33-generic instead.
	Attempt 5	: booted into 4.15.0-33-generic (recovery mode), chose the dpkg option, and it worked!!!!!
	--fixed--
2018-09-22 21:05:51 Usual case of going into airplane mode after boot-up (which according to past experience means my computer won't connect to wifi even after turning it off). So I shut down my laptop; but firmware update daemon was started after shutdown, and took ~1 minute to disappear.
At random intervals:	ubuntu 18.04 airplane mode lock on random (turning off simply doesn't make any wifi symbol)
		iwconfig:	lo	no wireless extensions.
		no usable wireless interface	#Don't even know how to fix this one.
2018-10-09 14:05:12 since yesterday, the laptop starts to disconnect from wifi stochastically even when wifi signal is strong. They come in bouts, but then seem to stop happening after a while.
2018-10-16 22:24:15 since installation (and later uninstallation) of "Mouse and Touchpad" there is a large deformed bluetooth sign that shows up on the top right, showing bluetooth to be on after start-up.
	Attempt 1: used the first solution here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/67758/how-can-i-deactivate-bluetooth-on-system-startup
	Attempt 2: sudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf, noticed bottomline says "#... Defaults to 'false'.
	AutoEnable=true" Therefore I turned Autoenable to False instead.
	Attempt 3: In the same page in Attempt 1, re-did answer 1, did answer 3 and 6(blacklist bluetooth, blacklist btusb), done 8.3 (sudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/blueman.desktop
gnome-session-properties#where I disabled the start-up applet for bluetooth); planning to remove the effects of answer 1,3,6 after re-boot to confirm that 8.3 works.
2018-10-17 06:41:03 bluetooth is now stuck at off position...
	Attempt 1: deleted "blacklist bluetooth", "blacklistbtusb", "rfkill block bluetooth"
	Fixed; but now it's default to ON again at startup...
	Ah no it's fine. I simply checked too early, which didn't have enough time for the gnome-session-properties applet run to turn off bluetooth.
2018-10-23 14:04:04 Wifi has been unstable in Uni.
	Attempt 1: Tried to make wifi more stable by https://askubuntu.com/questions/912977/wifi-not-connecting-in-ubuntu-14-04-dual-boot
	2018-10-23 18:36:46 boot up takes unusally long (stuck at loading screen "ubuntu ....." for ~2 minutes) after this fix. Perhaps it's not a coincidence.
	2018-10-24 08:14:19 problem with long boot-up time persist
	2018-10-24 14:06:49 but this is not consistent
	2018-10-24 21:12:56 For the last two boot ups, this problem persist. Commented out the previous changes, problem seems fixed for now. (But my mouse is not connecting properly)
	2018-10-25 12:14:02 Changed UOBwifi authentication to (WPA2Enterprise,Tunnelled TLS) while Eduroam stays the same (WPA&WPA2Enterprise,PEAP) wifi seesm stable now.
	2018-10-25 14:15:47 problem still exist inside the 115A MSc study room
	2018-10-27 01:56:40 Further diagnosis: when this problem crops up, the wifi sign is replaced with a "?"; but wavemon suggest it is still connected to the original wifi with no problem.
	2018-10-30 12:18:39 at the guild: wavemon shows that the internet works, but chrome doesn't for a ~10 seconds within 10 seconds
	2018-10-31 12:28:47 internet fairly unstable while I'm on campus wifi. At certain times speed drops to zero.
	But sometimes when I'm in the Windows partition in the guild the internet speed is also unbearably slow. So maybe it has to do with crappy wifi hardware instead of a fixable software bug.
	2018-11-13 13:27:17 It happened again; Top Right hand corner of the menu bar is showing "?" but wavemon shows that it works; fast.com shows it has ~13 Mbps connectivity. The only concern is that I don't want to use Evernote in low connectivity.
2018-11-04 12:24:39 gedit does not display last few lines near EOF if file is longer than screen length (reproducible when window is maximized):
	Attempt 1: sudo apt-get dist-update gedit# update was successful but doesn't fix the bug.
	Possible alternative solution: minimize window, scroll to bottom of page, and maximize window again.
		alternative solution2: swtich virtual desktop and switch back.
2018-11-06 10:03:56 Ubuntu suddenly locks itself without propmpt/warning. (Battery at 100%; was connected to Eduroam, browsing a pdf, open programs: nautilus, Chrome, Evince); took around 8 seconds to wait for lock screen to load+ type in password; once unlocked all programs appeared closed; Chrome prompts if I want to re-open unexpected closed tabs.
2018-11-29 15:42:44 trying to make the color scheme in Sublime-text 3 more bearable, i.e. more like gedit.
	Attempt 1	Color for sublime-text 3 was #1D425D at line 513 of cobalt2.tmTheme file at /home/ocean/.config/sublime-text-3/Installed Packages; changed it to #001B33
	Attempt 2	in the same file, line 25 #1f4662 was changed to #003B70 in attempt to change the line color.
	Attempt 3	2018-11-29 16:11:13 after much searching it was determined that this file /home/ocean/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/cobalt2/cobalt2.tmTheme is the correct one that controls the setting.s
		Changed line 163 (variable background color) and line 17 (global background color) to #001b33; while lineHighlight background color (line 25) is changed to #003B70
		Added "bold" into line 94 and 107 between the <string> brackets to make keywords and def bold.
		Added "bold" fontStyle property into the support.function class as well so that "print" and "range" also gets embolden.
2018-12-11 21:05:37 Mouse erratic scroll behaviour issue started to annoy me, so I cleaned the mouse wheel and it seems fine now.
2018-12-13 16:10:13 Accidentally booted into tty4; came out of it by messing about using the escape key. At the moment of logging into the tty4, the top-left hand corner of the screen seems to have some defect.
2019-01-02 14:33:47 Problem: 
	Attempt 1	sudo gedit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf to add the block of code specified here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/745135/how-to-enable-indirect-glx-contexts-iglx-in-ubuntu-14-04-lts-with-nvidia-gfx
	Attempt 2	Attempt 1 didn't work, so I deteled that code block from 50-ubuntu.conf and added a file 50-xserver-command.conf
		Failed. "50-xserver-command.conf" removed, and bypassing issue by going on campus computer instead.
