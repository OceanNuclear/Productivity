sudo prime-select intel #2018-07-03 21:13:40
2018-07-10 12:52:16 headphone audio is now fixed.
2018-07-11 10:32:38 did the first ANSWER in https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2326395 in attempt to ensure bluetooth is off when I turn on the computer.
2018-08-18 05:17:19 I have just changed all ~/*.sh script's top from #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash
2018-09-11 08:39:50 used lmt-config-gui to turn on cpuhotplugging. Let's see what happens.
2018-09-14 23:28:22 Loading up the latest Ubuntu version (.34) shows the "kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block" page.
	Temporary Fix: load up the .33 version.
	Attempt at fix: update in terminal while in the .33 version.
		First attempt at doing so^: freeze at loading up version ... page instead of the "kernel panic" page.
		Second attempt at doing so": same result as above^.
	Attempt 2 at fix: downloaded /home/ocean/Downloads/linux-tools-4.15.0-34-generic_4.15.0-34.37_16.04.1_i386.deb, and installed it.
		First attempt: Freeze at the blank, dark-purple page when booting from the first option in grub; but shows the "kernel panic" page when booting from the second option in grub (Advanced... ubuntu)
	Attempt 3	: https://askubuntu.com/questions/41930/kernel-panic-not-syncing-vfs-unable-to-mount-root-fs-on-unknown-block0-0
		First attempt: still does nothing.
	Attempt 4	: Turned off cpu hotplugging in lmt.
		First attempt: still shows the same screen. /home/ocean/Documents/UbuntuDebugging/DSC_0949.JPG
		More in-depth reading of the error message in the above link leads me to believe that it is possibly another feat of Nvidia.
		I will deal with this later, when I have time.
		In the meantime, I'll boot up from Advanced -> 4.15.0-33-generic instead.
	Attempt 5	: booted into 4.15.0-33-generic (recovery mode), chose the dpkg option, and it worked!!!!!
	--fixed--
2018-09-22 21:05:51 Usual case of going into airplane mode after boot-up (which according to past experience means my computer won't connect to wifi even after turning it off). So I shut down my laptop; but firmware update daemon was started after shutdown, and took ~1 minute to disappear.
	Insight 1: 2019-01-18 01:51:45 The usual green/white shutdown text were printted; this time the bottom line stuck at "Stopped jobs by snappy Daemon %d s/1 min 30s" &<number of seconds since the shutdown button was pressed> for 30 seconds, and then the line stopped counting down and scrolled out of sight. Therefore, I postulate that the amount of total waiting time required maybe 1.5 minutes *N where N<=4; since I assume there are a maximum of 4 of such processes; each of them silently counting down. ∴ I should wait for 6 more minutes before force-shutting down the laptop if it's stuck on the green/white text (scrolling) text screen. 
At random intervals:	ubuntu 18.04 airplane mode lock on random (turning off simply doesn't make any wifi symbol)
		iwconfig:	lo	no wireless extensions.
		no usable wireless interface	#Don't even know how to fix this one.
		Work-around: since this problem turns out to only occur after "shutting down Windows -> start up Ubuntu" series of events, I can simply reboot the Ubuntu and this problem will be fixed.
		Note: If the duration between "Windows Shutdown" and "Ubuntu bootup" is long enough this problem vanishes.
2018-10-09 14:05:12 since yesterday, the laptop starts to disconnect from wifi stochastically even when wifi signal is strong. They come in bouts, but then seem to stop happening after a while.
2018-10-16 22:24:15 since installation (and later uninstallation) of "Mouse and Touchpad" there is a large deformed bluetooth sign that shows up on the top right, showing bluetooth to be on after start-up.
	Attempt 1: used the first solution here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/67758/how-can-i-deactivate-bluetooth-on-system-startup
	Attempt 2: sudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf, noticed bottomline says
	```#... Defaults to 'false'.
	AutoEnable=true```
	Therefore I turned Autoenable to False instead.
	Attempt 3: In the same page in Attempt 1, re-did answer 1, did answer 3 and 6(blacklist bluetooth, blacklist btusb), done 8.3 (sudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/blueman.desktop
gnome-session-properties#where I disabled the start-up applet for bluetooth); planning to remove the effects of answer 1,3,6 after re-boot to confirm that 8.3 works.
2018-10-17 06:41:03 bluetooth is now stuck at off position...
	Attempt 1: deleted "blacklist bluetooth", "blacklistbtusb", "rfkill block bluetooth"
	Fixed; but now it's default to ON again at startup...
	Ah no it's fine. I simply checked too early, which didn't have enough time for the gnome-session-properties applet run to turn off bluetooth.
2018-10-23 14:04:04 Wifi has been unstable in Uni.
	Attempt 1: Tried to make wifi more stable by https://askubuntu.com/questions/912977/wifi-not-connecting-in-ubuntu-14-04-dual-boot
	2018-10-23 18:36:46 boot up takes unusally long (stuck at loading screen "ubuntu ....." for ~2 minutes) after this fix. Perhaps it's not a coincidence.
	2018-10-24 08:14:19 problem with long boot-up time persist
	2018-10-24 14:06:49 but this is not consistent
	2018-10-24 21:12:56 For the last two boot ups, this problem persist. Commented out the previous changes, problem seems fixed for now. (But my mouse is not connecting properly)
	2018-10-25 12:14:02 Changed UOBwifi authentication to (WPA2Enterprise,Tunnelled TLS) while Eduroam stays the same (WPA&WPA2Enterprise,PEAP) wifi seesm stable now.
	2018-10-25 14:15:47 problem still exist inside the 115A MSc study room
	2018-10-27 01:56:40 Further diagnosis: when this problem crops up, the wifi sign is replaced with a "?"; but wavemon suggest it is still connected to the original wifi with no problem.
	2018-10-30 12:18:39 at the guild: wavemon shows that the internet works, but chrome doesn't for a ~10 seconds within 10 seconds
	2018-10-31 12:28:47 internet fairly unstable while I'm on campus wifi. At certain times speed drops to zero.
	But sometimes when I'm in the Windows partition in the guild the internet speed is also unbearably slow. So maybe it has to do with crappy wifi hardware instead of a fixable software bug.
	2018-11-13 13:27:17 It happened again; Top Right hand corner of the menu bar is showing "?" but wavemon shows that it works; fast.com shows it has ~13 Mbps connectivity. The only concern is that I don't want to use Evernote in low connectivity.
2018-11-04 12:24:39 gedit does not display last few lines near EOF if file is longer than screen length (reproducible when window is maximized):
	Attempt 1: sudo apt-get dist-update gedit# update was successful but doesn't fix the bug.
	Possible alternative solution: minimize window, scroll to bottom of page, and maximize window again.
		alternative solution2: swtich virtual desktop and switch back.
2018-11-06 10:03:56 Ubuntu suddenly locks itself without propmpt/warning. (Battery at 100%; was connected to Eduroam, browsing a pdf, open programs: nautilus, Chrome, Evince); took around 8 seconds to wait for lock screen to load+ type in password; once unlocked all programs appeared closed; Chrome prompts if I want to re-open unexpected closed tabs.
2018-11-29 15:42:44 trying to make the color scheme in Sublime-text 3 more bearable, i.e. more like gedit.
	Attempt 1	Color for sublime-text 3 was #1D425D at line 513 of cobalt2.tmTheme file at /home/ocean/.config/sublime-text-3/Installed Packages; changed it to #001B33
	Attempt 2	in the same file, line 25 #1f4662 was changed to #003B70 in attempt to change the line color.
	Attempt 3	2018-11-29 16:11:13 after much searching it was determined that this file /home/ocean/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/cobalt2/cobalt2.tmTheme is the correct one that controls the setting.s
		Changed line 163 (variable background color) and line 17 (global background color) to #001b33; while lineHighlight background color (line 25) is changed to #003B70
		Added "bold" into line 94 and 107 between the <string> brackets to make keywords and def bold.
		Added "bold" fontStyle property into the support.function class as well so that "print" and "range" also gets embolden.
2018-12-11 21:05:37 Mouse erratic scroll behaviour issue started to annoy me, so I cleaned the mouse wheel and it seems fine now.
2018-12-13 16:10:13 Accidentally booted into tty4; came out of it by messing about using the escape key. At the moment of logging into the tty4, the top-left hand corner of the screen seems to have some display problem.
2019-01-02 14:33:47 Problem: 
	Attempt 1	sudo gedit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf to add the block of code specified here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/745135/how-to-enable-indirect-glx-contexts-iglx-in-ubuntu-14-04-lts-with-nvidia-gfx
	Attempt 2	Attempt 1 didn't work, so I deteled that code block from 50-ubuntu.conf and added a file 50-xserver-command.conf
		Failed. "50-xserver-command.conf" removed, and bypassing issue by going on campus computer instead.
2019-01-20 02:27:33 (After 2 days of painstaking debugging) the login loop problem has been solved. This is because I didn't update the Workspace Grid generously provided and maintained by Zakkak, so the outdated software broke under the new updates.
	I did a bunch of nvidia update in the process thinking that was the problem; but I guess that's a bit fucked.
	Fixed: by "dconf write /org/gnome/shell/disable-user-extensions", coming onto that, and turn back on Chrome's gnome extension auto update of Workspace Grid.
2019-01-20 morning  remaining config issues
	1. Ctrl+Alt+T won't work despite it being very obviously listed
	2. Alt-Tab won't work
	3. USB mouse won't work
	4. Timestamp custom shortcut doesn't work
	5. No animation upon switiching workspaces/any gnome-desktop actions.
	Attempt 1:Reboot
		Seems to fix the Ctrl+Alt+T and ctrl+/ shortcut; but Alt+Tab still remains
	AttempT 2: Issue 5 was fixed by logging in Ubuntu Wayland instead of other versions! Consider it fixed now. Seems to have fixed the custom shortcut issues too.
	Attempt 3: Issue 2 was resolved simply by changing the keyboard shotcut for "Switch windows directly" to Alt+Tab
	Attempt 4: Wireless mouse problem diagnosed as hardware problem.
	All config problems solved.
2019-01-20 09:26:06 some problems remain:
	After the initial start-up , the following problems crop up:
	1. Touchpad doesn't work
	2. gravekey wasn't change (crops up AFTER the initial post-start-up probation period)
	Issue 1 got resolved automatically after the initial post-start-up probation period ended/after typing "xinput; less /proc/bus/input/devices" into terminal (I don't know what triggered the probation period's end)
	I think this is because I unplugged my USB, so "@reboot /home/ocean/backslash.sh" in crontab changed the wrong USB device (NB the touchpad is connected to the laptop via internal USB.)
	Attempt 1: plugged in USB and rebooted: confirmed 1 was caused by unpluggin USB. Also 2 (grave key issue) apparently also exist in terminal BEFORE the thing.
	Attempt 2: the shift+F8 shortcut does it's job of calling the xmodmap script; but the xmodmap script doesn't work in some gtk applications (e.g. terminal, gedit.) So instead I'm editing my /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/* files. Replacing the first instance (line 80) of <TLDE> to "backslash, bar" in us doesn't work.
	Attempt 3: edited /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/gb instead, replacing every keyboard layout's <TLDE> key to use backslash bar instead. (And I forogt to save a backup for the original)
	Successful, even after reboot with all of the change grave key application turned off at startup.
	Attempt 4: Planning to map brokenbar, EuroSign, accented e, double dotted i, norwegian o, onto the keyboard using Alt-Gr in xmodmap.
		Apparently AltGr+4=>EuroSign, AltGr+=>oslash,  already works in non-GTK applications
		Also successfully mapped everything using backslash.sh
2019-01-21 06:13:27 Attempting to add shortcuts for gedit
	Attempt 1: Tried changing the dconf and editing ~/.config/gedit/accels as stated here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/223986/custom-keyboard-shortcuts-in-gedit but no luck.
2019-01-21 10:03:23 Sudden blackscreen->(Some error messages about power management)->login screen; perhaps its due to my hasty shutdown this morning.
	2019-01-26 16:22:21 same bug again as above; but there were no preciding hasty shutdown before, and it occurrsed 2 minutes after startup
	^Fix for these were simply to re-login.
	2019-01-30 15:15:35 same bug, this time it was achieved after closing chrome and then messing around switching workspaces.
	2019-01-30 15:55:31 Same bug, this time achieved after closing sublime-text-3, and it froze for ~30 seconds without me pressing any buttons/switching desktops. Nautilus was still visible in the background until it automatically logged me out.
	2019-01-31 13:20:33 again, this time it was when I was moving a Nautilus (windows explorer?) window across to a different workspace. Upon releasing the key the computer froze; long press the power button ~3 seconds logs me out, and upon re-logging in all applications were closed, as if I just started up.
	2019-01-31 13:23:46 AGAIN, immediately after. Exactly the same bug. Perhaps it has to do with moving workspace when starting up Libre Office.
	2019-02-23 17:37:29 Again. No clue what has happened, I just closed the Chrome window and moved workspace just before this happened. After re-logging in all windows disappeared.
2019-01-22 01:50:40 Modified everything in powertop's Tunables page to be "good"
2019-01-29 14:17:48 closed computer without using ctrl+L to lock computer; and then re-opened it too quickly, messed around on the power button; and then when I finally unlocked it 10 minutes later some non-gtk applications doesn't work
2019-01-30 17:09:36 ctrl+shift+left closed sublime text unexpectedly. (Maybe it's unrelated to the buttons that I'm tapping?)
	2019-01-30 17:33:18 same bug, this time I haven't even clicked on anything. Please stop.
	Both times occurred while in split view; so maybe that's where the problem exist?
	2019-01-30 19:18:40 it occurred a few more times, after my mouse idled for a long time in split view, and then as soon as I start to move my mouse it'll close sublime text.
2019-01-31 09:31:13 touchpad click and scroll stopped working in all applications; but can still move around; mouse-over hyperlink in all applications doesn't change the cursor to the selector icon; but scrolling and clicking still works after going to virtual desktop control view by pressing Super.
2019-03-17 00:58:12 Shortcut key to copy date doesn't work; and I can't type a single letter in chrome's search bar! Though copy and paste works fine. This happened after launching a .jar application. Issue was fixed (!!) after launching the same .jar executable file a second time.
	2019-03-22 11:38:28 same bug; this time shortly after the copy date shortcut failure, it froze and logged me out.
		The only clue I have is that this happened after the software updater finished updating, so maybe it's relevant.
2019-03-17 15:55:10 For some reason all the icons on the actual desktop disappeared when I logged in; but they were still present in the desktop directory. And I got suddenly logged out once while typing in this document; but then when I logged back in everything on the desktop appeared again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	2019-08-13 09:01:05 same bug, different day.
2019-03-29 00:32:00 mouse suddenly no longer work. Unplugging + plugging back in fixes it.
	For my own information:
		running "lsusb" in terminal should give 6 entries if the USB mouse is registered. The following entry should show up:
		Bus 001 Device 012: ID 1ea7:0064  
		(it's the shortest line)
		If it doesn't show up, then I have to unplug-plug back in.
2019-03-31 16:21:27 Annd for some reason I can't type on my keyboard again. WTF.
2019-06-15 03:56:09 problem booting up (stuck on the fourth line of message: (3rd and 4th line being"[OK] started process error reports when automatic reporting is enabled [OK] started user manager for UID 1000") 
	attempt 1: recovery mode, updated and upgraded everything; doesn't work.
	attempt 2: still in recovery mode, sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf to uncomment line 10 WaylandEnable=false (HOLY SHIT IT WORKED!)
2019-06-25 13:47:45 tensorflow acted up seriously; kept saying "can't import abs", probably due to a backward version (1.9) being used instead of the latest (1.14)
	Fix: uninstalled everything (multiple times) and installed the latest version; took 4 hours.
2019-07-03 07:37:31 Upon boot up the screen hung, with this message displayed: "/dev/nvme0n1p5: clean, nnn/nnn files, nnn/nnn blocks"
	attempt 1: to follow the second answer of here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/882385/dev-sda1-clean-this-message-appears-after-i-startup-my-laptop-then-it-w (by going (from tty1) into tty2 and "sudo apt-get update") but only made it worse, as after restarting, the same screen is shown, and when activating ttyx (x=2-6) it started flopping around between ttyx and tty1 at 2 Hz, which makes it impossible to type.
	attempt 2: Same url as above; sudo apt-get purge nvidia* didn't help.
	attempt 3+: did the following:
		boot-repair #installed the boot repair tool; only to realize it's useless.
		sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall #to install nvidia drivers -> "nvidia-driver-410"
	(planned next attempt (as of 2019-07-03 10:17:26): To comment away the WaylandEnable=false line in the /etc/gdm3/ directory.):<-Didn't actually do this because the attempt above actually worked!
2019-08-07 04:58:30 Wanted to create shortcut that switches windows between monitors; so I followed this: https://askubuntu.com/questions/141752/keyboard-shortcut-to-move-windows-between-monitors
	Doesn't work.
2019-09-13 11:59:15 Yesterday while fixing the bot, I did `systemctl disable apparmor.service --now;service apparmor teardown` resulting in sublime text not being able to boot up today; so I fixed it today by `sudo systemctl enable --now apparmor.service`.
2019-09-20 15:57:55 The audio doesn't turn off automatically after removing the headphones from the USBC jack; also, after waking up and loggin in from lock (Super+L; space to wake up; type in password), the first login led to the computer freezing, which, after pressing esc, returned to the login screen; typing in the password and stuff from that point on wakes it up properly.
2019-10-29 08:53:53 The computer froze without clear reason why (a few minutes ago some of the webpages didn't load at first try, but still loaded after the second try.)
2019-11-07 13:06:34 After accidentally uninstalling python3 and messing up most of the computer, reinstallation of all the effected module using "sudo apt-get install --reinstall <package>" has fixed a lot of bugs; but still leads to the occassional error of "ModuleNotFound" thrown at me.
	2019-11-08 10:47:03 Attempt ... N: after installing libatlas-base-dev gfortran as well, scipy installation seems to go more smoothly than before, i.e. metadata for wheel building was acquired without error. But it does eventually fail with the error message 
		EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/scipy'
Consider using the `--user` option or check the permissions.
		My first attempt to fix it was use --no-cache-dir, but the same error appeared. Then I used --user instead and it worked.¯\_(ツ)_/¯ In the end I isntalled scipy, matplotlib, and IPython using --user. However, it doesn't work as well as I intended, as ipython throws an error. So now I'll let Anaconda take over.
		Second attempt, after talking to the RSE: 2019-11-14 15:04:54: Reinstalled the python and python3 using Synaptic (graphical) package manager.
		2019-11-14 18:11:40 Window snapping ability using keyboard shortcut is very unreliable (and infuriating). But can be corrected by snapping any window once using your cursor.
2019-11-16 13:46:07 Booted into recovery mode: while all of my scripts (backslash.sh, copywords.py, etc.) works, some functionalities are lost, the most obvious one being that nvidia driver is not loaded so the screen is in huge text size i.e. very poor resolution.
	Attempt1: The problem of file space being filled up is solved by removing the ~/.cache/tracker/meta.db (which is a huge file).
	Because of the bug fix above, now Chrome can be opened, and stuff can be removed. BUT it is rapidly filling up again. I suspect this is what uses up my battery so quickly. 
	ACTUALLY no, something else in /var/ is filling it up, likely syslog. Now I've managed to stop it, after using rm -f on syslog, and then waiting for an hour or so.
	BUT it's rapidly filling up again. AND I've confirmed that it's filling up /var. And it's NOT in log.
	I suspect it's because of me making the wrong python3 link (pointing to anaconda instead). So I've removed that, and see if it stops.
	Well it doesn't. I haven't reverted it back yet (2019-11-16 15:51:49) But I have identified that it is a problem with /var.
	It has to be one of the packages.
	FUCK it is /var/log/syslog, but it's persisting after being deleted. P
	Anyways, now (2019-11-16 16:44:58) I've resorted to uncommenting this line on the bash file: (l143 export PATH="/home/ocean/anaconda3/bin:$PATH") which, intheory, should allow my python to work properly. At least for now.
	2019-11-16 16:51:00 Phew! It's fixed now (all keys work, gnome session booted up properly, nvidia driver is behaving perfectly). Now the text is smaller (I like it that way), though from the sound of it, it's still furiously writing to syslog. I.e. it's writing at the rate of 1e7 bytes per second. NOW I can confirm that all of the memory being used up comes from /var/log being written into. (AND NOTHING ELSE!)
	Note that once I turn off the computer, /var/log/syslog (or tmp file) gets destroyed and the memroy available gets freed up to 49% again.
	2019-11-17 00:05:34 Finally fixed everything by reversing back to the system version of python3 (3.6). So it's pretty easy actually. :(
2019-11-17 00:06:00 Now I only have to fix the bug of a super verbose docker debugger that is somehow hung up on writing infinitely messages to /var/log/syslog. This is FIXED by ```pkill docker``` :)))
2019-11-17 00:51:35 The only probelm with the solution above ^ is that I need to pkill docker everytime I start up. ∴ Need to mess around in crontab next time.
	Note: the problem of not being able to open terminal from the Dock/ Activities overview is purely due to having the wrong version of python referred to. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2019-11-17 00:54:57 Summary of what I've done+learned yesterday (before midnight) and today: 
	1. Do not change the system version of python. If you'd like to use more advanced version > python3.6 (which was decided at the time of your GNU/Linux installation), then use conda activate. conda is already updated to the latest stable python (3.7.4; 3.8.0 is not stable/ implementable as python3 as of today)
	2. You have two installations of Python: system version (```sudo update-alternatives --display python3```priority 1: 3.6; priority 2: 3.8) and conda (3.7.4).
	3. Anaconda can be updated with ```conda update conda``` while system version (3.6) can be updated with ```pip install --upgrade pip```. They need to be upgraded separately, but there is no harm in not upgrading the system version.
	4. My bash file appends the path ```export PATH="/home/ocean/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"``` onto python whenever I open terminal. Therefore if there are any system scripts that somehow starts the .bashrc before getting the first python interpreter in $PATH, then it may not find the system version python 3.6 package that it expects to have (IFF conda's python 3.7 doesn't have that packge but pip's (system's) python 3.6)
2019-11-18 12:19:39 Found out that it may be due to multiple installations of docker (https://askubuntu.com/questions/1188908/what-does-this-docker-log-entry-mean).
	Attempt 1: Considering that I only use docker-ce I have removed the version of docker installed by snap. ```docker``` (in terminal) still works after this.
	YEP! Problem fixed.
2019-11-18 17:44:47 The issue of noisy plotting (https://github.com/sherpa/sherpa/pull/537) remains. It seems to be an issue due to the mp package. Don't know how to fix, but will simply be living with it by only using python3 instead.
		Bug affects: plt plotting function, noisy Errors
		2019-11-19 14:16:19 Trying to fix that bug: dug through all of the similar errors, but I've pinpointed it to be due to the fact that IPython in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages is not getting updated to 3.7 (which anaconda was running with), but was somehow being used by anaconda. Since I don't want to mess around with pip a lot, I simply removed the /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ipy* and /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/IPython (moved them into a backup directory called ```dist-packages_old/```) and reinstalled ipython. (I realized this after comparing the content ```diff -y /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py /home/ocean/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py```, which should've been the same, considering that I should only have conda's version of IPython installed at that time.) ```conda install ipython numpy scipy pandas matplotlib seaborn anaconda-clean```  Well even after that it is still fucked. WHY?
		Additional problem: ```sudo apt-get install pip3``` leads to installation of an unusable version of pip (either 19.something or 9.something) which only works again after removing /home/ocean/.local/lib/python*/pip/.
		Even after that, it doesn't recover properly. At this point I can only assume that by uninstalling python, I've broken something without source code, i.e. some binary executable files is now permanently pointing to the wrong file. Therefore the only solution is to reinstall the OS.
	Current workarounds: currently I can use virtual environment with pip3, where matplotlib.pyplot isn't broken. This side-steps the issue of matplotlib misbehaving. Meanwhile, the noisy traceback and simply be ignored.
	2019-11-21 13:14:36 Re-installed conda, and made a virtual environment ("downgrade") in which python3.6.8 was installed instead. And then I installed ipython and scipy, and ran this script; and THIS time it's fine, i.e. no error in ipython3.6.
		So now I've progressively upgraded and realized that as soon as I upgrade it to 3.7.4 it WILL lead to an error. ∴I will leave my system version as 3.6 and use ipython there when necessary! Conda is used for canary work, i.e. upgrading to 3.8. (2019-11-21 13:39:37 It's been slowing trying to upgrade to 3.8 right now... It's been 10 minutes already.)
		2019-11-22 10:04:25 WTF conda's matplotlib in 3.8.0 suddenly started working, perhaps because I added the conda-forge channel. (but I only added it in the env that I deleted...) Therefore my only remaining concern is the noisy traceback...
2020-01-21 17:36:16 In Sublime text, I swapped the function of jump_to_last_region from shift+esc to esc. Also added a function. 
	2020-01-21 17:42:39 The files changed are /home/ocean/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Sublime-MultiEditUtils/Default (Linux).sublime-keymap and /home/ocean/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/Default (Linux).sublime-keymap
2020-04-24 09:58:45 (Not a bug) ```sudo apt-get update``` updated pulse-audio's .pa file at /etc/pulse/default.pa, while I kept my (customly modified) old version in custom.pa. In the future if the current version of defualt.pa causes things to break I can switch back by ```sudo rm /etc/pulse/default.pa; sudo mv /etc/pulse/custom.pa /etc/pulse/default.pa```
2020-05-23 14:14:45 The ctrl+shift+/ key (comment out command) doesn't work in sublime, after plugging in my Technet keyboard USB (externally) yesterday night (now already unplugged). According to https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/437201/why-does-not-keypresses-to-the-pause-break-key-reach-xev#comment790536_437252 the keypress event must've been captured by some application.
	Attempt(s): pkill gnome-shell did the trick, indicating that the problem is within gnome shell. Then futher messing around in gnome's dconf-editor made me realize that the problem must be with my custom shortcut of getShrug.
	Explanation: 2020-05-23 16:11:46 Turns out my gnome custom shortcut for getShrug was in the way (it was ctr+/); when the system receives the key <ctrl><shift></>, it looks at the <ctrl> modifier, and pairs it with the </> key, merge it into a new key (let's call it <ctrl/>), and then apply the shift modifier only to find that the system has no <shift><ctrl/> key. Therefore it stops there, without sending the signal to sublime.
	Fix: Assigned getShrug and getTimestamp to ctrl+shift+# and ctrl+# respectively since these shortcut keys seems to be unused in my workflow.
	
2020-07-06 16:59:00 Sudden log-off at 95 percent battery and plugged in. (symptoms before log-off: frozen screen, but music still playing)
2020-07-14 12:47:53 Another sudden log-off, 99% battery and plugged in. No frozen screen/playing music/any other symptom before the event, it came suddenly and without a sign.
