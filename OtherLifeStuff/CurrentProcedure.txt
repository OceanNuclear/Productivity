(Current *actual* procedure of how things are done)

Generate the FW spectrum - MCNP

Measure the FW spectrum - Unfolding (normal/ML)
    -> Source in MCNP

Calculation:
step 1:
    MCNP-MODEL with (parametric) plasma source
        -> expected FW spectrum (at irradiation station)
        -> expected Blanket spectrum

step 2:
    Take the 1st result of step 1 -> FISPACT model
        -> expected activities in the foils

step 3:
    Experimentally verify step 2 (unfolding)

    (if matching, then think more carefully about step 1)
        e.g.
        parametric plasma source was wrong
            missing/too many reactions included
            fuel percentage,
        materials (different moderation than expected)
    if still not matching: Add hard-coded Scotch Mist :|

PhD point:
    - ML: skip step 1+2
    - Normal unfolding: make step 2 easier

Far into the future:
    - Use ML algorithm on nuclear power plant + pneumatic system
    - gives efficiency, power production, fuel burnup,
